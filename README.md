**How to play**

The human player pawn is represented by a blue dot.
The AI player pawn is represented by a red dot.

The goal is to reach your treasure before the AI. (Good luck !)

Once it is your turn (as indicated on the left side of the interface):
1. Perform a tile shift: 
	- rotate the side tile how you desire,
	- click on the yellow arrow corresponding to the desired tile shift.
2. Move your pawn: click on an approachable tile (a tile which is connected to your current tile by a path).

Once the game is finished, you have the option to click on "Play Again" and retry another game.

Have fun playing against the AI !
